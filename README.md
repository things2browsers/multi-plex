Reference design and implementation of a WebUSB,USBCDC,WebBluetooth FW+WebApp solution

This project will contain reference design(s) and implementation(s) of a 'super connected' device, utilizing (as a minimum):

* WebBluetooth
* WebUSB
* USBCDC

An obvious benefit, for the industry (including legacy ones moving to web) and users, is that
this will make it possible to disregard connection technology and move focus to the actual solution (not e.g. BLE - but 'A thermostat')

Both firmware and web applications will be created.
